# LCDSched-button-TaskScheduler
Arduino 16x2 LCD with buttons example working with the Arkhipenko/TaskScheduler

This is a very simple example on using the arkhipendo/TaskScheduler https://github.com/arkhipenko/TaskScheduler
and the LCD/button shield.
The intent is to comment the sketch file and understand how github works by testing pull requests.  
I assume a Branch is for major versions.  Minor versions do not seem to be available within a Branch... hum... 
Once a commit is done, the file in the Branch seems to be overwritten and unaccessible.
