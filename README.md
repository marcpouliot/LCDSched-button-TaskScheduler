# LCDSched-button-TaskScheduler
Arduino 16x2 LCD with buttons example working with the Arkhipenko/TaskScheduler

This is a very simple example on using the arkhipendo/TaskScheduler https://github.com/arkhipenko/TaskScheduler
and the LCD/button shield.
The intent is to comment the sketch file and understand how github works by testing pull requests.  
I assume a Branch is for major versions.

It will compile ok only if function prototypes are NOT required. next versions has function protoytypes but I do not use github for my projects, the concept is esay to understand (I used sccs in my young days), but the usage gives me headaches...
